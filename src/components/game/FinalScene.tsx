                You just walked through a little world I made just for you. 
                Everything you saw, every star you collected, was to remind you of one simple thing:
                <strong> You are so, so loved.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                You're more than my best friend. You're the person who makes me feel calm, who I can be silly with, and who always makes me laugh.
                I made this little game because just saying how much you mean to me isn't enough. I wanted to show you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I made this place feel soft and kind, just like you make the real world feel to me. 
                I donâ€™t know how you do it, but when you're around, even the bad days feel better.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Youâ€™ve been there for me when I didnâ€™t even ask. Youâ€™ve made me feel seen. Youâ€™ve made me feel safe.
                And honestly, Nooni, if I could build you a thousand little worlds like this, I would. Just to see you smile.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                So when this little game is over, please remember:
                <strong> You are wonderful. You are a bright light. You are my forever friend.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-right text-lg">â€” From me, always ðŸ’™</p>
        </div>
      </motion.div>
    </motion.div>
