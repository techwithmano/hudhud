                If youâ€™re reading this, then youâ€™ve walked through a world built just for you.
                Every flower that bloomed, every star you collected â€” it was all made to remind you of something simple, but so true:
                <strong> You are loved beyond words.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                You are more than a best friend. Youâ€™re my calm, my chaos, my comfort, my favorite laugh.
                I made this game because I couldnâ€™t just say how much you mean to me â€” I had to show you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Every corner of this place was shaped by the way you make the real world feel softer.
                I donâ€™t know how you do it, but when youâ€™re near, even the worst days feel okay.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Youâ€™ve been there for me when I didnâ€™t even ask. Youâ€™ve made me feel seen. Youâ€™ve made me feel safe.
                And I swear, Nooni, if I could build you a thousand gardens like this, I would â€” just to watch you smile as you walk through them.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                So when the screen goes dark and this little world fades, remember:
                <strong> You are magic. You are light. You are my forever friend.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-right text-lg">â€” From me, always ðŸ’™</p>
        </div>
      </motion.div>
    </motion.div>
  );
